## Overview
Here is my first project with FrontEnd Mentor
### The challenge
Create an Order Summary page for an unknown company. 

### Built with



-HTML 
-CSS
### What I learned

I learned how to use SVG files in both HTML and CSS. I have mainly been learning how to code throught Codeacademy and I can't recall ever using an svg file in any of the projects. In their projects you mainly use the img tag with either a PNG of JPG file. So having however what others may see as a minor obstacle, it took me a while to overcome as when I would insert my svg my text would not go over it. Which i resolved this issue by looking more into z-index and positioning.
